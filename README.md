# URL Shortener Microservice

---

## User Stories:

*  I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.

*  If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.

* When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.

## Example:

`https://fcc3-url-sho.glitch.me/new/http://www.example.com` has short form as `https://fcc3-url-sho.glitch.me/HkggtnrC-`
